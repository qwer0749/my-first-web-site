<h1>JavaScript</h1>
<p>
    JavaScript ( English : JavaScript ) is an object-based script programming language . 
    This language is primarily used within web browsers and has the ability to access built-in 
    objects in other applications. It is also used in server programming, such as runtime 
    environments such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich 
    of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name Mocha and later as LiveScript,
     which ultimately became JavaScript. Although JavaScript has some similarities in syntax 
     with Sun Microsystems' Java , this is because both languages ​​are based on the basic 
     syntax of the C language , and the direct relationship between Java and JavaScript is 
     weak. Other than the name and syntax , it has more similarities to Self or Scheme than 
     to Java . JavaScript is recognized as the language that best implements the standard 
     specifications of ECMAScript. It was supported by default in most browsers until 
     ECMAScript 5 (ES5), but from ECMAScript 6 onwards, it is compiled with a transpiler 
     for browser compatibility . [4]
