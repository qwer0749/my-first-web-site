    A White House spokesman said on Friday that the American-led military strikes on Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen were not intended to ignite a wider regional war, even as Houthi leaders and their allies vowed to respond.

“We’re not interested in a war with Yemen,” said the spokesman, John F. Kirby. “We’re not interested in a conflict of any kind. In fact everything the president has been doing has been trying to prevent any escalation of conflict, including the strikes last night.”

President Biden, however, made it clear later on Friday that the United States was prepared to strike Yemen again if the Houthi rebel group did not relent in its attacks on shipping. During a visit to Pennsylvania, he said the United States and its allies would “make sure that we respond to the Houthis if they continue with this outrageous behavior.”

The United States, Britain and a handful of other allies launched air and naval strikes early Friday against more than a dozen targets linked to the Houthi militia. Some American allies in the Arab world have expressed doubts that the attacks would deter the Houthis and concerns that they could further inflame a region seething over Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. Oman, a U.S. ally that has mediated talks with the Houthis, criticized the strikes and expressed its “deep concern.”

The U.S.-led strikes were a sharp escalation of American action against Houthi drone and missile attacks in the crucial commercial shipping lanes of the Red Sea, which the militia has said are in support of Palestinians under Israeli bombardment in Gaza.

The Biden administration and some allies, while intent on averting a wider conflict, had issued ultimatums to the Houthis warning of serious consequences if they did not stop firing at ships. Since the Houthis began their attacks in November, global shipping lines that use the Red Sea and the Suez Canal have diverted hundreds of vessels around Africa, routes that take far longer and add costs to cargo deliveries.

Here is what else to know:

Israel presented its defense at the International Court of Justice in The Hague on Friday in a case accusing it of carrying out genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Palestinians have hailed the case as a chance for justice. Israel strenuously denies the charge, calling it a perversion of history for a country founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust.

Germany said it will intervene on Israel’s behalf in the genocide case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. The German government said there is “no basis whatsoever” to South Africa’s claim that Israel is committing genocide its war in Gaza.

The U.S.-led strikes in Yemen hit radars, missile- and drone-launch sites, and weapons storage areas, according to two American officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Biden administration officials said the strikes were intended to hinder the Houthis’ ability to strike Red Sea targets, rather than to kill leaders and Iranian trainers, which could be viewed as more escalatory. A Houthi spokesman said at least five of its fighters were killed.

Russia requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Friday to discuss the U.S.-led strikes, according to a diplomat from France, which holds the rotating Council presidency this month. The session was to be held in closed consultations, according to the diplomat.

Oil prices rose sharply on concerns that the Middle East conflict could be spreading. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose by about 4 percent to just over $80 a barrel.
